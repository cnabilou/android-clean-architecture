# Introduction 
This Android project is to be used as a starting point for all new Android projects. It is implemented using the Clean Architecture pattern.

It is written in Kotlin and we will try to keep all the libraries update to date when it makes sense.

The clean architecture may not make sense to all projects. So it is up the developer to decide what is best for the situation.
